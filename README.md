# 360° VR Image Viewer & Gallery

A lightweight 360° image viewer designed for desktop browsers, mobile devices, and VR headsets such as the **Pico 4** using the **Wolvic** browser.  
The viewer is built using **A‑Frame**, supports **WebXR**, and loads images dynamically via a simple PHP parameter.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **360° equirectangular image viewing**
- **Native VR mode** through WebXR (Wolvic / Pico 4 compatible)
- **Dynamic image loading** using `?img=` URL parameter
- **Loading screen** while textures decode
- **YouTube‑style drag direction** (optional)
- **Ultra‑simple deployment** — just drop into any PHP‑enabled web server
- **Works offline** and on local networks

---

## 📦 How It Works

### 1. Load an image via URL parameter

The viewer accepts an image path like this:

```
viewer.php?img=/gallery/images/IMG_20260105_095606_00_004.jpg
```

If no parameter is provided, a default image is shown.

### 2. PHP injects the image into A‑Frame

```php
<a-sky src="<?php echo $img; ?>"></a-sky>
```

This makes the viewer extremely flexible — you can generate links dynamically, build galleries, or integrate with upload scripts.

### 3. VR mode (WebXR)

When opened in **Wolvic** on a **Pico 4**, the viewer automatically shows a VR button.  
Entering VR gives full head‑tracking and immersive viewing.

### 4. Loading overlay

A small loader is shown until the 360° texture is fully decoded:

```js
sky.addEventListener('materialtextureloaded', () => {
    loader.style.display = 'none';
});
```

This prevents the user from seeing a blurry or stretched placeholder.

## 📁 File Structure

```
/viewer.php        → Main 360° viewer
/js/aframe.min.js  → A‑Frame library
/gallery/images/   → Your 360° photos
/README.md         → This file
/LICENSE           → MIT License
```

## 🖼 Example Usage

Open a 360° image:

```
https://yourdomain.com/viewer.php?img=/gallery/images/panorama.jpg
```

Embed in HTML:

```html
<a href="viewer.php?img=/gallery/images/panorama.jpg">Open in VR</a>
```

## 🧩 Requirements

- PHP-enabled web server (Apache, Nginx, Caddy, etc.)
- A‑Frame 1.4+  
- HTTPS recommended for WebXR  
- VR headset + Wolvic browser for immersive mode

---

## 🛠 Future Ideas

- Automatic folder-based gallery
- Next/previous navigation inside VR
- Hotspots and annotations
- Slideshow mode
- Auto‑generate thumbnails
